# bendTokens

bendTokens(etc bendETH) are interest-bearing tokens that are minted and burned upon deposit and withdraw. The bendTokens' value is pegged to the value of the corresponding deposited asset at a 1:1 ratio, and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All interest collected by the bendTokens reserves are distributed to bendTokens holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance.

For all minting and burning actions, see Deposit() and Withdraw() methods in the LendPool contract.

## ERC20 Methods

All standard ERC20 methods are implemented, such as balanceOf(), transfer(), transferFrom(), approve(), totalSupply(), etc.
