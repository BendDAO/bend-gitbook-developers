# Introduction

## What is BendDAO

BendDAO is a decentralized non-custodial NFT liquidity and lending protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralized (perpetually) using NFTs as collateral, or un-collateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.

The following documentation describes the fundamentals of the protocol and how to interact with it. Please join the #development room in the BendDAO community [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BendDAO); our team and members of the community look forward to helping you build on top of Bend.

The protocol is implemented as a set of smart contracts on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts guarantee safety and do not require an intermediary agent.
