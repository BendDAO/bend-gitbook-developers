| APY                   | Annual Percentage Yield, which is the yield/interest after a year, which includes compounding interest. Note that this is different from Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which does not take into account compounding effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| LTV                   | Loan To Value, or Collateral Ration. The maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. If a collateral has a Loan to Value of 75%, for every 1 ETH worth of collateral the user will be able to borrow 0.75 ETH worth of principal currency. The Loan To Value is specified per collateral and expressed in percentage points.                                                                                                                                                     |

The liquidation threshold is specified per collateral and expressed in percentage points.                                                                                                                          |
| Liquidation Bonus     | The floor price discount for buying collateral paid by liquidators to incentive the purchase of specific collateral that has a health factor below 1. The Liquidation Bonus is specified per collateral and expressed in percentage points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Health factor         | Represents the ratio between total collateral multiplied by the liquidation threshold, and the borrowed principal. When the Health Factor goes below 1, the loan is under-collateralized and can be liquidated. Also see `liquidate()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Ray units             | For internal calculations and to reduce the impact of rounding errors, the protocol uses the concept of Ray Math. A Ray is a unit with 27 decimals of precision. All the rates (liquidity/borrow/utilization rates) as well as the cumulative indexes and the aTokens exchange rates are expressed in Ray.Please refer to the following [article](https://medium.com/dapphub/introducing-ds-math-an-innovative-safe-math-library-d58bc88313da) for further details about this concept. |
